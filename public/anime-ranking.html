<h1>The best TV shows according to Pham Thanh Dat</h1>
<h2>My top 3 anime series of all times.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Attack on titan</h3>
<p>Love the plot twists. The story line is really tightened.</p>
<h3>Gintama</h3>
<p>Its comedic aspest is really entertaining. But the show can be serious too if it needs to.</p>
<h3>Jujutsu Kaisen</h3>
<p>I especially love the tactic driven aspect when it comes to combat. I really love the fighting scene in this anime.</p>
